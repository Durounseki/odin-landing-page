# Gruel

This website is inspired by the assignments on the *Odin project* (TOP). The concept is a parody of a
protein supplement company.

The home page is the result of TOP's Foundations second assignment. All the images and product descriptions were generated using Google's Gemini advance. The assignment asks for a "Roboto" font but "Moderne Sans" was chosen instead, for stylistic purposes. The sign-up button at the bottom of the page links to the sign up form.

The Sign up form is the result of the first assignment in TOP's Intermediate HTML and CSS course. The form is processed on javascript, the default error messages were replaced and the form displays a welcome message when the submit button is clicked and all the fields are valid.
