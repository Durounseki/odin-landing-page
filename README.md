# Gruel

This page is inspired by the second assignment on the *Odin project*. The concept is a parody of a
protein supplement company. All the images and product descriptions were generated using Google's
Gemini advance. The SNs icons are courtesy of flaticon.com. The assignment asks for a "Roboto" font but
"Moderne Sans" was chosen instead for stylistic purposes.
